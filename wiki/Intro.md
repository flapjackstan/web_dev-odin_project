# Welcome to my Odin Project wiki!

I've been getting more and more into web development and am doing the Odin Project to get me a solid understanding of fundamentals. So far it's been going great and am really digging the web side of engineering.

# Foundational HTML

I'm very pleased with how much I learned about http and glad I spent more time to learn more about how the internet works. In addition to learning about http through the odin project, I also explored using the python requests library that uses http and used it to connect to the airtable api. It helped solidify what I learned and how its used to communicate data accross the web. Aside from that I also liked making the recipes page.
